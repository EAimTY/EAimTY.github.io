I am EAimTY, a developer mainly working on open source softwares, a digital nomad, a negative perfectionist, a person who cannot integrate into the surrounding environment, and a lonely wanderer.

This site, EAimTY’s blog, was originally created by me under the drive of my love in technology. It mainly records my exploration of content that interests me. Although there is not much content, it records how I have been advancing in terms of thought and skill for many years. As I gradually matured, I will publish more texts here about my ideas and thoughts, rather than *technology* which can be considered purely rational.

You may find this blog to be the ugliest blog you have ever seen - I don’t mind - there is no desire to continue reading. In fact, I also think so. I have spent a lot of energy decorating my website, but by looking back, I found that what is really meaningful is thought and idea I have written, rather than the blog itself. If my content is what you expect, we have fate. On the contrary, if you close it after opening my website for one second, you will not lose anything. What we love and pursue must have great differences.

I was born in a city in northern China. I have a somehow both authoritative and relaxed family environment surrounding with both avant-garde and conservative thoughts. Due to the fact that I have been exposed to too much information that most people cannot access due to special social environments at an early age, as well as my negative perfectionism tendency, I gradually discovered that I was out of touch with the environment around me, having difficulty on establishing new relationship with others. After experiencing my own unsuccessful and unhappy student career, I started the lonely digital nomad life.

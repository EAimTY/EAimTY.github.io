# Why You Should Not Support Me

The driving force behind my contributions to open source project and the maintenance of my content has always been my passion for technology. However, I cannot guarantee that I will continue to do these things indefinitely. I donâ€™t know what I will be like in the future, and my passion will also change over time. Moreover, the maintenance of some projects and content will also face some risks.

Therefore, when you support me, you are not supporting me as a person directly, nor any of my projects, nor my promise to the future. You are affirming the time and energy I have devoted to the open source world.
